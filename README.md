# SnowboarderGame

A simple single-player game created during the course on 2D Unity Development on Udemy taught by members of GameDev.tv.

The snowboarder moves along the slope and the player's goal is to help him get till the end pole without dying. The player can control snowboarders balance with left and right arrows, making him tip in one direction or another. The control also works when the player is airborn with even greater force, allowing him to perform spins and other snowboard tricks.
